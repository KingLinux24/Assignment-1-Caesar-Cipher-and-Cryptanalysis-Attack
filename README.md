# Cryptography Labs

This repository contains my practical implementations and exercises in cryptography.
## Assignment 1: Caesar Cipher and Cryptanalysis Attack

This directory focuses on the Caesar Cipher and its Brute Force Cryptanalysis.

Features:
Encryption: Encrypts plaintext using a user-defined key.

Decryption: Decrypts ciphertext with a given key.

Brute Force Attack: Attempts to find the correct key by trying all 26 possible shifts.

How to Run:
1. Clone this repository:

` ```bash 
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Cryptography-Labs.git
cd Cryptography-Labs/Assignment_1_Caesar_Cipher # Adjust path if different`

2. Execute the Python script:

 ` ```bash
python caesar_cipher.py`

Follow the interactive menu prompts.
